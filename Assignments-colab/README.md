# Google colab notebook files for Chapters

The jupyter notebook files here are meant to run on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

## What is this for?

Since we all have different OS platforms, the colabs here are meant to test the code.
Google colab servers are running on Linux, where we can use bash commands.

## What is this **NOT** for

This is **not** for submitting your assignments and codes. 

We still encourage that you manage to run things on your local machine (e.g., your favorite IDE, debugging, testing, getting used to using terminal, etc.)

## Okay I got it. How do I run the jupyter notebooks on colab?

Select the jupyter notebook you want to run, and then click the blue button that reads "
Open in colab".
