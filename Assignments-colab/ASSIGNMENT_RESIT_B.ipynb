        "Entities are things (usually people/places/organizations/etc) that exist in the real world. SpaCy can tag texts with entity types. If an expression refers to an entity in the world, it will receive a lable indicating the type (for example, Barack Obama will be tagged as 'PERSON'. Since the expression 'Barack Obama' consists of two tokens, each token will receive such a label. Use dir() on a token object to find out how to get this information. Hint: **Everything about entities starts with ('ent_')**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Position of the entity token**\n",
        "\n",
        "An expression referring to an entity can consist of multiple tokens. To indicate that multiple tokens are part of the same/of different expressions, we often use the IOB system. In this system, we indicate whether a token is outside an entity mention, inside an entity mention or at the beginning of an entity mention.  In practice, most tokens of a text will thus be tagged as 'O'. 'Barack' will be tagged as 'B' and 'Obama' as 'I' (see example above). SpaCy can do this type of labeling. Use dir() on a token object to find out how to get this information. "
