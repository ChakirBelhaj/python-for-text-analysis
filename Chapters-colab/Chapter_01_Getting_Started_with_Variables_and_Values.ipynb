        "\n",
        "Welcome to the course! In this course we will learn how to load, process and save data using a versatile programming language: Python. We are going to practise Python using Notebooks. These Notebooks contain instructions and so called 'code blocks'. The instructions are paragraphs of text that explain the concepts we are going to use. The 'code blocks' contain Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: Jupyter has integrated different languages now! This means that your menue is probably shown in your language rather than in English. Please take this into account when reading the instructions. \n",

        "* You can create a new cell by hitting the '+' button on top. \n",
        "* The instructions are written in Markdown. You can select whether a cell should contain markdown or code by clicking on the drop-down menue on top. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a nice Markdown cheatsheet if you want to write some more.\n",

        "#### A note on getting stuck:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Please note that learning how to code is a process that usually heavily relies on 'trial and error'. This means that throughout the course, you will repeatedly have to try out different solutions until you find out what works (and hopefully why). Having to try several times is completely normal and part of the process - please do not get discouraged. \n",
        "- It is highly recommended to start learning how to 'debug' your own code early on. If you do not know what to do or get error messages, try and take a step back and think about what you were doing and why. Using pen and paper to break down problems into smaller steps is highly recommeded. We will highlight different debugging strategies throughout the course. \n",
